== Building

Java JDK version 8 (preferred) or 7 is required.
See {oracle-download}[Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8 Downloads] or {openjdk-download}[OpenJDK].

Gradle is used for the build.

[TIP]
The _gradlew_ / _gradlew.bat_ script will download Gradle on first run.
No previous install is needed (if one exists, it will be ignored).

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew
----

The HTML output will be generated in _build/html5/_, the PDF in _build/pdf/_.
One PDF per programming language is built.

To exclude building the PDF output, do like this:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -PnoPdf
----

To do a clean build of all outputs do:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean dist
----

Execute a new build automatically as soon as there are file changes:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew -t
----
