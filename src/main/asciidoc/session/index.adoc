[abstract]
--
All interaction with a Neo4j server takes place within a session.
--

A session is used to run statements against Neo4j.
A session is obtained from a driver object.
It allows for running statements against the database.

The driver has a session pool which can be configured.
Sessions are returned to the pool when they are closed.
It is important to close sessions, to allow them to return to the pool and be reused.

[CAUTION]
--
It is important to provide for the closing of a session in the case where an exception is thrown.
Make sure that the exceptional path of execution, as well as the ordinary, closes the session.
