=== Session State

A session can be in three states:
_READY_, _RESULT_, and _FAILED_.

A session begins in _READY_ mode.
When a query is executed, the session changes states.

If execution is successful, the session enters _RESULT_ state.
The results are available for consumption.
When the entire result stream is consumed, the session returns to _READY_ state.

If execution is not successful, the session enters _FAILED_ state.

// TODO:
// 1) How does the user handle the failed state?
// 2) Document the _IGNORED_ that happens when client has not acknoledged _FAILED_ state.
