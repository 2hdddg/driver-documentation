=== Concepts

'Concept' comes from the latin _concipio_, meaning 'I grasp'.
Thus the same latin root gives us _to conceive_, meaning that act of the intellect whereby the soul is formally identical with a material substance, 'grasping it' through or under a 'concept',
and the biological act of generating a new human being in the womb.
It is rather poetic that the embryo of a child of the mind and of a child of the body share an etymological ancestry.
