The preferred way to access a Neo4j server from an application is to use a Neo4j driver.
--

The Neo4j Driver API is the preferred means of programmatic interaction with a Neo4j database server.
It implements the Bolt protocol and is available for .NET, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

The API is defined independently of any programming language.
This allows for a high degree of uniformity across languages.
Uniformity means that the same features are included in all the drivers.
The uniformity also influences the design of the API in each language.
This provides consistency across drivers, while retaining affinity with the idioms of each programming language.
// TODO: "API" used in conflicting ways.
// Rework this paragraph, spell out verbosely in causal language what we are trying to say first.
// Then tighten it up and make it concise and precise.
