// TODO:
A `Driver` object can be created from your database object.
It typically lives for the duration of your application.
Use a `Driver` to create `Session`s.

The only reason to create more than one driver would be
  if you have multiple destinations/URLs to create sessions for.
(For HA purposes, or pulling data out of one database and pushing into another.)
