A driver object lives for the duration of an application.

[NOTE]
--
The driver maintains a connection pool for each Neo4j instance.
It is recommended to use the same driver instance across an application.

// TODO: I don't understand this:
//       above, one driver can connect to several instances,
//       below, the only case when you would need two drivers is when you want to pull data from one database and push to another.
//       also, how can a driver connect to two instances with the same URL?

The only reason to create more than one driver is if there are multiple destinations/URLs for which to create sessions.
(For HA purposes, or to pull data out of one database and push it into another.)
