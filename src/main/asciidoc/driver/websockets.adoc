[[websockets]]
=== Websockets

REMOVE

Accessed on the same port, since we're multiplexing.
Functionally speaking we have four different ways of connecting

Standard TCP
    plain
    encrypted
Websockets
    plain
    encrypted

Same functionality.
Tradeoff: plain sockets are faster (SSL ~20% slower) so useful if you are in a _safe environment_.


Standard TCP sockets vs Websockts
default: Standard

Websockets exist for enfironment where there is no standard socket library, (i.e. the browser).

All drivers support TLS or Plain
All drivers support one or the other of Standard/Websockets, not necessarily both.
