=== SSL / TLS

Traffic using the Uniform Language Drivers is encrypted by default,
  using SSL/TLS.
If you want unencrpyted communication you can configure the Neo4j server to listen to a different port.
Please see \{some-handy-attribute-for-the-correct-page-in-the-manual\} for information on how to do that.

// It looks like there will be no way to turn on/off in Driver.
// Possibly not mention this much beyond: "Please see server docs for configuration."
