[[url-format]]
== Bolt URL Format

The Bolt URL follows the standard URL pattern of `scheme://hostname:port`.

The simplest Bolt URL, `bolt://localhost:7687`, has `bolt` as scheme and connects to localhost on the default port `7687`.

In order to do the following, the server must be configured accordingly:

* To connect to Neo4j on a different port.
* To disable default security.
* To manually control the use of a WebSocket.

The driver is then configured to connect to the server in the desired way by altering the URL.
For example, `bolt://server:1234` would connect using the Bolt protocol to `server` on port `1234`.
