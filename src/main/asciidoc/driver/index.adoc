[[driver]]
== Driver

Some may argue that the opposite of Uniform Drivers is Casual Drivers, or even Naked Drivers.
This is of course preposterous.
The opposite and complement of Uniform Drivers is Uniform Passengers,
  as should be obvious to anyone upon serious reflection.
A valiant case has been made by the Dry Cleaner's guild that,
  as two negatives cancel out,
  the true opposite is Iform Drivers.
Needless to say, this frivolous play on words was uniformly frowned upon by the rest of the community.
