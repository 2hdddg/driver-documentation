// TODO: NS said there isn't anything to configuring a driver except the URL, but the JavaDocs talk about controlling the connection pool policy by passing a configuration object when constructing it.

The minimal configuration necessary to use a Neo4j driver is a Bolt URL.

[[url-format]]
== Bolt URL Format

The Bolt URL follows the standard URL pattern of `scheme://hostname:port`.

The simplest Bolt URL has `bolt` as scheme and uses the default Neo4j port `7474`, for example `bolt://localhost:7474`.

To do the following, the server must be configured:

* To connect to Neo4j on a different port.
* To disable default security.
* To manually control the use of a WebSocket.

// TODO: Better example

The driver is then configured to connect to the server in the desired way by altering the URL.
For example, `bolt+ssl://server:1234` would connect using SSL to `server` on port `1234`.

[[ssl-tls]]
== SSL / TLS

Traffic using the Neo4j Drivers is encrypted by default, using SSL/TLS.
If you want unencrypted communication you can configure the Neo4j server to listen to a different port.
Please see \{some-handy-attribute-for-the-correct-page-in-the-manual\} for information on how to do that.

// Nigel: It looks like there will be no way to turn on/off in Driver.
// Possibly not mention this much beyond: "Please see server docs for configuration."

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

// Below is taken from Javadoc for `org.neo4j.driver.v1.Config`.
// Not all information is included and the defaults are made up.

In addition to the Bolt URL, the driver can be configured for:

* logging
* connection pool size
* connection pool behavior
* authentication strategies
