The minimal configuration necessary to use a Neo4j driver is a Bolt URL.

[[ssl-tls]]
== SSL / TLS

Traffic using the Neo4j Drivers is encrypted by default, using SSL/TLS.
If you want unencrypted communication you can configure the Neo4j server to listen to a different port.
Please see \{some-handy-attribute-for-the-correct-page-in-the-manual\} for information on how to do that.

// Nigel: It looks like there will be no way to turn on/off in Driver.
// Possibly not mention this much beyond: "Please see server docs for configuration."


[[configuration]]
== Configuration

In addition to the Bolt URL, the driver can be configured for:

* connection pool size
* connection pool behavior
* authentication strategies
* logging

=== Security

The driver can be configured to use TLS encryption.

Two authentication strategies are available:

* Trust on first use.
* Trust signed certificate.

_Trust on first use_ means that the driver will trust the first connection to a host to be safe and intentional.
On subsequent connections, the driver will verify that the host is the same as on that first connection.

_Trust signed certificate_ means that the driver will only connect to a host if it presents a trusted, signed certificate.
