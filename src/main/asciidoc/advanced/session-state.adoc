= Session State

A session can be in three states:

* `READY`
* `RESULT`
* `FAILED`

A session begins in the `READY` mode.
When a query is executed, the session changes state.

If the execution is successful, the session enters the `RESULT` state.
The results are now available for consumption.
When the entire result stream is consumed, the session returns to the `READY` state.

If the execution is not successful, the session enters the `FAILED` state.
