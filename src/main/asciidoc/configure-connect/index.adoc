= Configure and connect

[abstract]
--
Configure a driver and use it to connect to Neo4j.
The driver provides sessions that are the context of one or more transactions of work against the database.
--

A driver object instance can be shared globally throughout an application and across multiple threads.
It contains a pool of connections to various members of the cluster which can be borrowed to carry out work.

Closing a driver closes all connections spawned by that driver, whether or not they are currently in use.
