= Lifecycle

For most use cases, it is recommended to use a single driver instance throughout an application.
The only reason to create multiple driver instances is to connect to multiple servers.
This may be useful when connecting to multiple members of a cluster, or for pulling data out of one database to push to another.
In other cases, a single driver instance usually serves the requirements of a single application.

// TODO: "Driver" is ambiguous above: The Java driver may maintain _a connection pool for each Neo4j instance_,
//       but the single _driver object_ can only connect to one Neo4j instance and therefore can only have one connection pool.
//       Verify this with the driver team and update the text.
